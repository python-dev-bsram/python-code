    "#### What is OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It helps in organizing code so it can be easily scaled and maintained by creating objects. An object is just an instance of a class, The class defines what data (attributes) and actions (methods) the object will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attributes are variables that hold data related to the object, and we can access them using a dot (.).\n",
    "- Methods are functions inside the class that define what the object can do.\n",
    "- Properties are a way to control how we get or set the values of attributes, often with some extra logic added."
