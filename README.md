This repository will covers all the fundamentals and advaced concepts of the python. Including DSA, multi tasking.

#### [Python Fundamentals](https://github.com/python-dev-bsram/python-code/blob/main/fundamentals.ipynb)

Python Fundamentals provides a  overview of essential Python concepts, enabling developers to build a solid foundation in programming. Hereâ€™s what you can learn programming:

- Identifiers: Understand how to create meaningful and readable names for variables and functions, enhancing code clarity and maintainability.

- Datatypes and Data Structures: Gain insight into Python's fundamental data types (like integers and strings) and data structures (such as lists and dictionaries), learning how to choose the right type for your data.

- Loops: Learn to automate repetitive tasks using loops, allowing for efficient iteration over data collections and reducing code redundancy.

- Python Operators: Familiarize yourself with various operators that manipulate data, enabling you to perform calculations, comparisons, and logical operations effectively.

- List Methods: Master a range of built-in methods for list manipulation, equipping you with the skills to manage collections of data dynamically and efficiently.

- Type Conversions: Discover how to convert between data types to ensure compatibility and accuracy in data manipulation and operations.

- Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy: Understand the differences between shallow and deep copies, empowering you to manage object duplication and memory usage more effectively.

- String Formatting: Learn the various methods for formatting strings, which enhances output readability and allows for dynamic content generation in your programs.

#### [Object - Oriented -Programming](https://github.com/python-dev-bsram/python-code/tree/main/object-oriented-programming)

Object - oriented give you the intution and reality of how to develop the code and design the software. From this concepts will learn how to scale the code , write the modular code , oops design principles , goals.  and identify the difference in procedure and object oriented programming for scaling and modeling.
